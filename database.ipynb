To expand our candidate search, we engage in direct field recruiting and establish relationships with community organizations (COIs). We also extend our office hours to accommodate potential applicants. In addition, we offer referral bonuses to incentivize our employees and partners to recommend suitable candidates. To reach a broader audience, we leverage the effectiveness of popular job boards such as Indeed, CareerBuilder, and ZipRecruiter. Furthermore, we organize regular job fairs and conduct on-site recruitment, often collaborating with companies that are downsizing to provide opportunities for displaced employees.\\nOur comprehensive selection process begins with behavior-based interviews, which allow us to assess candidates thoroughly. We also administer skill assessments tailored to the specific job duties. To ensure the suitability of applicants, we conduct reference checks, verify education credentials, perform background checks, and implement drug screening procedures. In some cases, client-specific testing criteria, vision assessments, or health evaluations may also be conducted. During the interview process, we closely evaluate previous work history, any gaps in employment, and the candidate's attentiveness to detail.\\nAs part of our assessment, each applicant completes an Essential Functions worksheet, allowing us to gauge their ability to meet the physical requirements of the position. By familiarizing ourselves with our customers' company culture, expectations, and standard operating procedures (SOPs), we are better equipped to determine the optimal candidate match for each role.\\nOverall, our approach prioritizes diligent candidate screening, thorough assessments, and a deep understanding of our customers' needs to ensure we provide the most suitable candidates who align with their organizational culture and expectations.\", linked_org=None, id=12),\n",

       " Answer(text='\"We are committed to doing the right thing even when itÕs not easy. Integrity to us means being honest, trustworthy, and Òdoing rightÓ by our associates and clients by making and keeping commitments. Building partnerships of trust with all stakeholders aligns with our purpose of helping people and organizations improve. We partner with our clients, our associates and each other to create the greatest value possible. Each member of the Partners team is empowered with ownership, while being held accountable to ourselves and our customers. We recognize that both our clients and our associate employees are our customers and of essential importance.  We are committed to developing personalized relationships with all customers to understand and fulfill their needs.\\n\\nThe companyÕs key innovation is its focus on associate development for the benefit of the client. It seeks long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with associates to help them get the best jobs and to improve their everyday lives. In alignment with its emphasis on associate welfare, the company provides a certified MEC healthcare plan at no out-of-pocket cost for all associates, and it is currently developing a comprehensive certification and education advancement program through Partners Academy on its proprietary LMS platform. These associate-focused innovations ensure that clients receive the best talent to help them grow their businesses, resulting in a two-way, symbiotic synergy that helps both customer sets improve, grow, and achieve their goals. \\nPartners is deeply committed to a human-centric approach in the design of its recruitment funnel and strategy. This approach is embodied in a unique trifecta of specializations: the Recruiting Specialist, Client Specialist, and Partnership Specialist. Recruiting Specialists are focused on building relationships with candidates in local markets and on supporting them through the recruitment and onboarding process. Client Specialists develop a thorough understanding of the clientÕs business goals and staffing needs, match associates with assignments, and follow up with both parties to ensure high-quality engagement. Partnership Specialists are dedicated onsite staff members who exclusively work with Premier Partnership clients and associates. Acting as a liaison between the branch and the client, they manage large onsite accounts of 50-plus associates and consistently make themselves available to both associates and the client. \\nThe three Specialist roles are supported by three groups: an Implementation Team, Recruiting Support Team, and Regional Marketing Partners. These groups are dedicated to assisting the branches where and when it matters most. The Implementation Team is a group of highly skilled staffing professionals who are the first Òboots on the groundÓ onsite to ensure a smooth transition into the Partners Program. The Recruiting Support Team consists of remote and travelling recruiters who supplement local team efforts, including after hours. Regional Marketing Partners (RMPs) are highly skilled recruitment marketing experts. They strategize, create, execute, and optimize digital recruitment strategies to fill the top of the recruitment funnel. RMPs are dedicated to their specific markets and are tasked to thoroughly understand and implement the best recruitment strategies in each market. With this support, local teams can spend more quality time and build stronger relationships with candidates and associates. The results are happier associates, reduced absenteeism, increased performance, less turnover, and more referrals.\"', linked_org=None, id=147),\n",
