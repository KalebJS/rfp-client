We recognize that both our clients and our associate employees are our customers and of essential importance.  We are committed to developing personalized relationships with all customers to understand and fulfill their needs.

The company's key innovation is its focus on associate development for the benefit of the client. It seeks long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with associates to help them get the best jobs and to improve their everyday lives. In alignment with its emphasis on associate welfare, the company provides a certified MEC healthcare plan at no out-of-pocket cost for all associates, and it is currently developing a comprehensive certification and education advancement program through Partners Academy on its proprietary LMS platform.

Partners is deeply committed to a human-centric approach in the design of its recruitment funnel and strategy. This approach is embodied in a unique trifecta of specializations: the Recruiting Specialist, Client Specialist, and Partnership Specialist. Recruiting Specialists are focused on building relationships with candidates in local markets and on supporting them through the recruitment and onboarding process. Client Specialists develop a thorough understanding of the client's business goals and staffing needs, match associates with assignments, and follow up with both parties to ensure high-quality engagement. Partnership Specialists are dedicated onsite staff members who exclusively work with Premier Partnership clients and associates. Acting as a liaison between the branch and the client, they manage large onsite accounts of 50-plus associates and consistently make themselves available to both associates and the client. 
The three Specialist roles are supported by three groups: an Implementation Team, Recruiting Support Team, and Regional Marketing Partners. These groups are dedicated to assisting the branches where and when it matters most. The Implementation Team is a group of highly skilled staffing professionals who are the first ""boots on the ground"" onsite to ensure a smooth transition into the Partners Program. The Recruiting Support Team consists of remote and travelling recruiters who supplement local team efforts, including after hours. Regional Marketing Partners (RMPs) are highly skilled recruitment marketing experts. They strategize, create, execute, and optimize digital recruitment strategies to fill the top of the recruitment funnel. RMPs are dedicated to their specific markets and are tasked to thoroughly understand and implement the best recruitment strategies in each market. With this support, local teams can spend more quality time and build stronger relationships with candidates and associates. The results are happier associates, reduced absenteeism, increased performance, less turnover, and more referrals.""",0

What action or steps do you implement to retain employees throughout the season?
","Ex 1: We perform extensive screening for candidates that best match the job descriptions and are comfortable with the expectations at each site. We take care of all of our associates and over-communicate to ensure successful placement.                                                                                                                                                           
Ex 2: Employee Recognition
We are firm believers in recognizing and rewarding good behavior and have met with much success using some of these employee appreciation efforts 
-	Employee of the Month - working together with supervisory staff in identifying deserving associates each month.
-	Raffle Employee Attendance Program.  Anyone with 100% attendance with 40 hours plus in a week, raffle items (gas cards, gift cards, CASH). 
-	Employee ""Goal"" Lunch or Raffle:  When an employee or ""Team"" achieves a set goal or exceeds expectations, we would sponsor a special lunch or do a raffle for that Team. This approach can also be very effective in achieving higher attendance.
